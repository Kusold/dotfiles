# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. They are in a constant state of evolution as my workflow changes.

## Managing symlinks
I am using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage the symlinks. It is written in python, so it should work cross platform without any issues.

### Applying the symlinks
`$ ./install`
