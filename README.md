# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. They are in a constant state of evolution as my workflow changes.

### Install
`$ make`

## External Dependencies
* [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - makes zsh prettier and more useful
* [ansiweather](https://github.com/fcambus/ansiweather) - fetch the weather from the command line
* [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) - vim plugin manager
* [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) - tmux plugin manager
* [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/install/) - faster grep for code. Fetched the single file version for simplicity.

## Terminal Colors
I use the excellent [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) package for colors. My favorite theme is [eighties](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#eighties)

## Someday:
GPG
* npmrc with `sign-git-tag`
