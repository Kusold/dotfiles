# Dotfiles

## Install
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kusold/dotfiles/master/bin/bootstrap | bash
```

## Terminal Colors
I use the excellent [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) package for colors. My favorite theme is [eighties](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#eighties)

## Someday:
* Remove nodenv, rbenv, etc... and manage versions with asdf
